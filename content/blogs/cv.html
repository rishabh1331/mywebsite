<p>MY BACKGROUND-</p>
<p>I was born in the Republic of India in July 1998, and have spent the last 5 years in Dubai. I am reading for the Masters in Analytics and Management degree at London Business School and wish to undertake a career in tech and consulting.</p>
<p>Due to my multicultural background I was, and still is, always interested in learning new approaches and adopting several points of view. As far as I can remember, I always was very interested in quantitative topics, and when I grew I started to develop interpersonal and leadership skills whilst pursuing my passion for numbers and mathematical puzzles.</p>
<p>Outside of the academic and professional framework, I love playing soccer/football and chess, I am also an avid swimmer.</p>
<p>Below is my CV, and feel free to reach out:</p>
