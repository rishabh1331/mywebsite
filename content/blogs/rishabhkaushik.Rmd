## Hello 
My name is **Rishabh Kaushik** and Iâ€™m a tech enthusiast and a keen believer in learning. I have done my engineering from Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Dubai([school website--](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/Dubai/)) in computer science. Having lived in Dubai and India, I have developed a keen understanding of different cultures. 
I also had the opportunity to understand deep implication of the data analytics on the finance industry during my internship at Grant Thornton Dubai. 
I have knowledge and interest in data analytics, machine learning and visualization tools.
While in school, I earned excellence award for my exemplary academic performance and leadership skills.
I love to go for hikes and treks.
I play the following sports- 
- Football
- Cricket

# Task 2: `gapminder` country comparison


```{r}
glimpse(gapminder)
head(gapminder, 20) # look at the first 20 rows of the dataframe
country_data <- gapminder %>% 
            filter(country == "India") # just choosing Greece, as this is where I come from 
continent_data <- gapminder %>% 
            filter(continent == "Asia")
```



```{r}
plot1 <- ggplot(continent_data, mapping = aes(x = year, y = lifeExp))+
geom_col() +
geom_smooth(se = FALSE)+
NULL 
plot1 <- plot1 +
labs(title = "Change in Life Expectancy over the years in India ",
     x = "Year",
     y = "Life Expectancy") +
  NULL

ggplot(gapminder, mapping = aes(x = year , y =lifeExp, colour= country, group =country))+
geom_point() + 
geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
NULL
```



```{r}
ggplot(data = gapminder , mapping = aes(x = year , y = lifeExp , colour= continent))+
geom_point()+ 
geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
scale_y_log10()+
facet_wrap(~continent) +
theme(legend.position="none") + #remove all legends
NULL
```



Life Expectancy since 1952 has increased across all the continents. However, the life expectancy in Africa remained almost the same post 1990 with one outlier in 1991. For rest of the continents, the life expectancy has increased since 1952 though we can see lot of outliers in Asia and Europe.

# Task 4: Animal rescue incidents attended by the London Fire Brigade

```{r}
url <- "https://data.london.gov.uk/download/animal-rescue-incidents-attended-by-lfb/8a7d91c2-9aec-4bde-937a-3998f4717cd8/Animal%20Rescue%20incidents%20attended%20by%20LFB%20from%20Jan%202009.csv"

animal_rescue <- read_csv(url,
                          locale = locale(encoding = "CP1252")) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names()


glimpse(animal_rescue)
```


```{r}
animal_rescue %>% 
  dplyr::group_by(cal_year) %>% 
  summarise(count=n())
```


```{r}
animal_rescue %>% 
  count(cal_year, name="count")
```

```{r}
animal_rescue %>% 
  group_by(animal_group_parent) %>% 
  
  summarise(count = n()) %>% 

  mutate(percent = round(100*count/sum(count),2)) %>% 
  
  # arrange() sorts the data by percent. Since the default sorting is min to max and we would like to see it sorted
  # in descending order (max to min), we use arrange(desc()) 
  arrange(desc(percent))
```


```{r}
 animal_rescue %>% 
  
  #count does the same thing as group_by and summarise
  # name = "count" will call the column with the counts "count" ( exciting, I know)
  # and 'sort=TRUE' will sort them from max to min
  count(animal_group_parent, name="count", sort=TRUE) %>% 
  mutate(percent = round(100*count/sum(count),2))
```
 
Do you see anything strange in these tables? 

Finally, let us have a loot at the notional cost for rescuing each of these animals. As the LFB says,

> Please note that any cost included is a notional cost calculated based on the length of time rounded up to the nearest hour spent by Pump, Aerial and FRU appliances at the incident and charged at the current Brigade hourly rate.

Before we go on, however, we need to fix `incident_notional_cost` as it is stored as a `chr`, or character, rather than a number.

```{r}
typeof(animal_rescue$incident_notional_cost)
```

# readr::parse_number() will convert any numerical values stored as characters into numbers

```{r}
animal_rescue <- animal_rescue %>% 

  # we use mutate() to use the parse_number() function and overwrite the same variable
  mutate(incident_notional_cost = parse_number(incident_notional_cost))

# incident_notional_cost from dataframe `animal_rescue` is now 'double' or numeric
typeof(animal_rescue$incident_notional_cost)

```


```{r}
animal_rescue %>% 
  

  group_by(animal_group_parent) %>% 

  filter(n()>6) %>% 

  summarise(mean_incident_cost = mean (incident_notional_cost, na.rm=TRUE),
            median_incident_cost = median (incident_notional_cost, na.rm=TRUE),
            sd_incident_cost = sd (incident_notional_cost, na.rm=TRUE),
            min_incident_cost = min (incident_notional_cost, na.rm=TRUE),
            max_incident_cost = max (incident_notional_cost, na.rm=TRUE),
            count = n()) %>% 

  arrange((desc(mean_incident_cost))) 
```





Compare the mean and the median for each animal group. waht do you think this is telling us?
Anything else that stands out? Any outliers?

Finally, let us plot a few plots that show the distribution of incident_cost for each animal group.

```{r}
base_plot <- animal_rescue %>% 
  group_by(animal_group_parent) %>% 
  filter(n()>6) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=incident_notional_cost))+
  facet_wrap(~animal_group_parent, scales = "free")+
  theme_bw()

base_plot + geom_histogram()

```

```{r}
base_plot + geom_density()
```

```{r}
base_plot + geom_boxplot()
```

```{r}
base_plot + stat_ecdf(geom = "step", pad = FALSE) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent)
```
