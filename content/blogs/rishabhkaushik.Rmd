## Hello 
My name is **Rishabh Kaushik** and Iâ€™m a tech enthusiast. During my 2nd year of engineering, I got a chance to participate in Road and Transport Authority Hackathon. The Hackathon was about providing innovative transport solutions to the current Dubai Taxi Services. 
We came up with an idea of a smart kiosk and a point of sale device to book cabs. Our idea was liked by the judges at RTA, and hence we were provided incubation from the RTA. After working on the idea for more than a year and succesfully implementing it in more than 100 locations, we mutually decided with Dubai Taxi Corporation to take our idea forward in other Emirates through public body connects.
